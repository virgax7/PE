# triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:
#
# triangle	 	tn=n(n+1)/2	 	1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...
# pentagonal	 	pn=n(3nâˆ’1)/2	 	1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...
# hexagonal	 	hn=n(2nâˆ’1)	 	1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...
# it can be verified that t285 = p165 = h143 = 40755.
#
# find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
